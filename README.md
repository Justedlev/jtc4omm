# ðŸ”ƒ Java type converters for org.modelmapper

---

### ðŸ¤” Why?

I was inspired to create __jtc4omm__ (java type converters for org.modelmapper), because I noticed that I often implement converters in my projects, either as a separate module or inside the project itself (I believe that Iâ€™m not the only one who encountered this), so What are you looking for, simple converters for one of the powerful tools of [modelmapper](https://modelmapper.org/)

### ðŸ¤– Set

What has already been implemented:

| Name              | Implenemts                    | Resource                                                                                    |
